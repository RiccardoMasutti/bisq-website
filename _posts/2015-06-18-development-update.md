It was a bit quiet here the last months, but there was going on a lot on the development front.

I have implemented the support for various **payment methods** (OKPay, SEPA, AliPay, Swish, â€¦) and the **arbitration system**.

We also have now **Altcoins support!** So you can change safely and in a decentralized way your Altcoin against Bitcoin.

The arbitration system comes with a complete messaging/chat system so it is integrated to the process in a way that it makes the life for arbitrators and traders as easy as possible in case of a dispute.

I just published a [video][1] of the current application showing all those new features.

Stay tuned we are getting closer to the release!
